&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science&lt;/em&gt; by John Zelle
     Most often, going through python lessons is a drag in which one feels totally lost. But, it's always rewarding when a finished product is involved (e.g., this blog), and I hope to generate more tangible goods soon.  Looking to do something more "data analysis" related next time because with a science background, it is of greater interest.  But, yours truly cannot do everything, and feel stretched thin when working on programming.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Man In the High Castle&lt;/em&gt; by Philip k. Dick
    It is a romp through an alternate history years after WWII where the Germans won and an arms race is occurring between them and the Japanese. It's a tale of an alternative present, questioning our perception of reality and the records that follow.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ted Chiang's short story collection, &lt;em&gt;Story of Your Life and Others&lt;/em&gt; 
    One of my favorites from the book was originally published in Nature as &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v405/n6786/full/405517a0.html"&gt;Catching Crumbs from the Table&lt;/a&gt;.  It is a futuristic look at a research world dominated by metahumans, causing a knowledge gap for human scientists. Not as dystopian as it sounds.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many articles and a few books on current trends in biotech and healthcare. On deck is a book touting     the benefits of personalized healthcare, titled &lt;a href="http://www.%20%20%20%20%20%20amazon.com/The-Creative-Destruction-Medicine-Revolution/dp/0465025501"&gt;The Creative Destruction of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Search of Lost Time, vol 1: Swann's Way&lt;/em&gt; by Marcel Proust
    The passages in this book will exercise your memory facilities, conjuring up thoughts, feelings, you have not revisited in many years.  2013 also marks the 100th anniversary of its publication.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Mapping the Brain with Big Science</title><link href="http://phenotypic.net/mapping-the-brain-with-big-science.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-03-31T20:52:37-07:00</updated><author><name></name></author><id>tag:phenotypic.net,2013-03-31:mapping-the-brain-with-big-science.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;At a time when only &lt;a href="http://report.nih.gov/success_rates/"&gt;1 in 5&lt;/a&gt; researchers secure grant funding and many scientists are struggling to find qualified work, details recently emerged on a potential groundbreaking project called the Brain Activity Map (aka BAM).  The multi-billion dollar proposal follows in the footsteps of similar large-scale science projects such as the Human Genome and recent ENCODE.  Initial reports of BAM occurred after President Obama’s State of The Union address, where he once again emphasized the importance of Science &amp;amp; Technology  (STEM) to ease the nations fears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project, which the administration has been looking to unveil as early as March, will include federal agencies, private foundations and teams of neuroscientists and nanoscientists in a concerted effort to advance the knowledge of the brain’s billions of neurons and gain greater insights into       perception, actions and, ultimately, consciousness.
&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/science/project-seeks-to-build-map-of-human-brain.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complex proposal involves studying all cell types of the brain, and dissecting each of their roles in neuronal pathways. Many of the current technologies studying the brain are limited in sensitivity. For example, &lt;a href="http://pleasandexcuses.com/2012/08/01/what-the-heck-does-a-brain-scan-really-measure/"&gt;fMRI relies of changes in blood flow patterns&lt;/a&gt; to estimate brain activity. Various technologies such as nanonsensors, 3D imaging, and synthetic biology would need to be developed and refined to measure brain signaling pathways for BAM to deliver cutting edge results.  The Obama administration wants scientists to come up with homerun answers for complex problems such as obesity and neurodegeneration.  But, considering we are still piecing together the interworking’s of lower animal brains (e.g, fruit flies, rodents), the ~ 3 lb. blob in our skulls seems incredibly daunting.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important concern surrounds the cost/benefit of these “Big Science” endeavors.   Molecular biologist, George Church, said in the NYTs that “we will probably get a lot more bang for the buck,” when compared to the Human Genome Project.  The benefits of the Genome Project really depend on whom you ask.  Many private genomic sequencing firms dominate biotech headlines with their venture capital funding, but the clinical benefits are just now bearing fruit.  Prenatal genetic screening is a recent example (23 years after that project's inception) and is still not a clinical standard.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word on the project’s funding fate is expected to occur anytime.  Regardless of the funding decision, more neuroscience research money is warranted to make needed progress on the brain disorders affecting so many people.  The current rates of Alzheimer's disease alone justifies a full-fledged public health crisis.  That said, the payoff from mapping these human neuronal pathways with BAM would be years down the road. While transhumanists may praise such a proposal, its promise is still in the realm of science fiction with little translatable to the clinic. But even more disturbing, this heavy, top-down approach only consolidates research funds to a select group of powerful scientists. As Michael Eison of UC-Berkeley recently said in &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/behind-the-scenes-of-a-brain-mapping-moon-shot-1.12543"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, “What motivates people to pursue these big projects is not the belief that they will solve problems… It’s the belief that this is the way to get money.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
