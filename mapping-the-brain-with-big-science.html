            <h1>Mapping the Brain with Big Science</h1>
            December 24 2013

 


        </div>
	
        <div><p>At a time when only <a href="http://report.nih.gov/success_rates/">1 in 5</a> researchers secure grant funding and many scientists are struggling to find qualified work, details recently emerged on a potential groundbreaking project called the Brain Activity Map (aka BAM).  The multi-billion dollar proposal follows in the footsteps of similar large-scale science projects such as the Human Genome and recent ENCODE.  Initial reports of BAM occurred after President Obama’s State of The Union address, where he once again emphasized the importance of Science &amp; Technology  (STEM) to ease the nations fears. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The project, which the administration has been looking to unveil as early as March, will include federal agencies, private foundations and teams of neuroscientists and nanoscientists in a concerted effort to advance the knowledge of the brain’s billions of neurons and gain greater insights into       perception, actions and, ultimately, consciousness.
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/science/project-seeks-to-build-map-of-human-brain.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">New York Times</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The complex proposal involves studying all cell types of the brain, and dissecting each of their roles in neuronal pathways. Many of the current technologies studying the brain are limited in sensitivity. For example, <a href="http://pleasandexcuses.com/2012/08/01/what-the-heck-does-a-brain-scan-really-measure/">fMRI relies of changes in blood flow patterns</a> to estimate brain activity. Various technologies such as nanonsensors, 3D imaging, and synthetic biology would need to be developed and refined to measure brain signaling pathways for BAM to deliver cutting edge results.  The Obama administration wants scientists to come up with homerun answers for complex problems such as obesity and neurodegeneration.  But, considering we are still piecing together the interworking’s of lower animal brains (e.g, fruit flies, rodents), the ~ 3 lb. blob in our skulls seems incredibly daunting.  </p>
<p>Another important concern surrounds the cost/benefit of these “Big Science” endeavors.   Molecular biologist, George Church, said in the NYTs that “we will probably get a lot more bang for the buck,” when compared to the Human Genome Project.  The benefits of the Genome Project really depend on whom you ask.  Many private genomic sequencing firms dominate biotech headlines with their venture capital funding, but the clinical benefits are just now bearing fruit.  Prenatal genetic screening is a recent example (23 years after that project's inception) and is still not a clinical standard.  </p>
<p>Word on the project’s funding fate is expected to occur anytime.  Regardless of the funding decision, more neuroscience research money is warranted to make needed progress on the brain disorders affecting so many people.  The current rates of Alzheimer's disease alone justifies a full-fledged public health crisis.  That said, the payoff from mapping these human neuronal pathways with BAM would be years down the road. While transhumanists may praise such a proposal, its promise is still in the realm of science fiction with little translatable to the clinic. But even more disturbing, this heavy, top-down approach only consolidates research funds to a select group of powerful scientists. As Michael Eison of UC-Berkeley recently said in <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/behind-the-scenes-of-a-brain-mapping-moon-shot-1.12543">Nature</a>, “What motivates people to pursue these big projects is not the belief that they will solve problems… It’s the belief that this is the way to get money.”</p></div>
