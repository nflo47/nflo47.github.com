            <h1>The Race for New Heart Drugs</h1>
            December 24 2013

        <div><p>With all the hype over personalized medicine the past few years, the field has yet to deliver on translating the Human Genome Project into clinical value beyond the mountains of sequencing data. But, in a unique approach combining detailed subject physiological information and genomic data, hope and hype surrounds a new low-density lipoprotein (LDL) target to battle heart disease.  The underlying truth of the gene PCSK9  is currently being revealed in clinical studies to develop new cholesterol fighting, antibodies. It’s also making pharma CEOs salivate with direct to consumer ads buzzing in their eardrums. </p>
<p>What makes this enzyme (full name: proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) fascinating and potentially worth billions for drug developers? It’s ability to push LDL (aka “bad cholesterol”) to unseen low levels as reported in mid-stage clinical studies from Pfizer (New Jersey), Sanofi (France), and Amgen (America). These companies and a few others have touted positive results in toxicity and efficacy, with the pivotal <a href="http://Clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=PCSK9+AND+low+density+lipoprotein+cholesterol">Phase III studies</a> now in the limelight.  </p>
<p>The discovery of this enzyme as a potential blockbuster cholesterol therapy stems from the novel way in that the clinical studies were designed.  Based off early studies, it was inferred that a knockout mutation in PCSK9 would result in significantly lower cholesterol levels.  <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/genetics-a-gene-of-rare-effect-1.12773">Clinical research team Helen Hobbs and Jonathan Cohen</a> at UT Southwestern took people with extremely high and low LDL, stratified them accordingly, and it eventually demonstrated the low LDL group had a missense mutation in their PCSK9 gene.  In a nutshell, they started with the phenotypic basis of heart disease and reduced down to Mendelian level genetics to illustrate mutation’s role in keeping cholesterol levels down.</p>
<p>The current treatment for high cholesterol predominantly consists of statins (e.g., Lipitor, Crestor).  According to rock star physician Eric Topol, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/opinion/the-diabetes-dilemma-for-sta
tin-users.html?_r=0">statins only reduces the rate</a> of heart attack’s in patients trying to lower the risk to a pathetic 2 in 100, and there are harmful side effects such as forgetfulness and muscle pain. So clearly there is need for better medications to treat heart disease.  Large-scale randomized controlled trial data will be the next step for the aforementioned drug companies to showcase if approval for the drug is warranted.</p>
<p>Since these new classes of drugs are expensive monoclonal antibodies, they may need to be significantly more effective than current treatments to receive FDA approval.  Antibody therapeutics are notoriously pricey, and these could very well cost patients tens of thousands of dollars.  If one of the companies can formulate into a cheaper, oral pill then that may give them an advantage over competition. These are some of the important questions to consider if any of the drugs can fine their way to the marketplace. </p></div>
