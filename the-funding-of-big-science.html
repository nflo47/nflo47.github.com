            <h1>The Funding of Big Science</h1>
            March 31 2013

 


        </div>
	
        <div><p>At a time when only about <a href="http://report.nih.gov/success_rates/">1 in 5</a> researchers secure grant funding and many scientists are struggling to find qualified work, details recently emerged on a potential groundbreaking project called the Brain Activity Map (aka BAM).  The multi-billion dollar proposal follows in the footsteps of similar large-scale projects such as the Human Genome and recent ENCODE.  Initial reports of BAM occurred after Pres. Obama’s SOU address, where he once again emphasized the importance of Science &amp; Technology  (STEM) to quell the nations fears. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The project, which the administration has been looking to unveil as early as March, will include &gt;federal agencies, private foundations and teams of neuroscientists and nanoscientists in a concerted effort to advance the knowledge of the brain’s billions of neurons and gain greater insights into       &gt;perception, actions and, ultimately, consciousness.
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/science/project-seeks-to-build-map-of-human-brain.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">New York Times</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The complex proposal involves studying all cell types of the brain, and dissecting each of their roles in neural pathways. Many of the current technologies studying the brain are limited in scope <a href="http://pleasandexcuses.com/2012/08/01/">fMRI relies of changes in blood flow patterns</a>what-the-heck-does-a-brain-scan-really-measure/as a crude estimate of the physiological processes happening inside someone’s head while it’s scanned.  Various technologies such as nanonsensors, 3D imaging, and synthetic biology will need to be developed and refined to tackle the task.  The Obama administration wants science to come up with homerun answers for complex problems such as obesity and neurodegeneration.  But, considering scientists are still piecing together the interworking’s of lower animal brains (e.g, fruit flies, rodents), the ~ 3 lb. blob in our skulls seems incredibly daunting.  </p>
<p>Another important concern surrounds the cost/benefit of these types of these massive “Big Science” endeavors.   Molecular biologist, George Church, claims in the NYTs that “we will probably get a lot more bang for the buck,” when compared to the Human Genome Project.  The benefits of the Genome project really depends on who you ask.  Many private Genomic sequencing firms dominate biotech headlines with their venture capital funds, but the clinical benefits are just now emerging.  Prenatal genetic screening is a recent emergence, and still about 23 years after the HGP’s inception.  Science moves slowly, and we live in age of instant gratification.  This is something our elected officials still need to realize.    </p>
<p>Word on the project’s funding fate is expected to occur anytime.  Regardless of the funding decision, more neuroscience research is needed to make needed progress on the various brain disorders affecting so many people, from Alzheimer’s to autism. The payoff from mapping these human neuronal pahtways would be years down the road. While transhumanists may praise this effort, the promise is still currently in rhe realm of science fiction with little translatable to the clinic. Furthermore,  a heavy, top-down approach would only consolidate the research funds to a select group of powerful scientists from the nations’ most prestigious institutions. As Michael Eison of UC-Berkeley recently said in <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/behind-the-scenes-of-a-brain-mapping-moon-shot-1.12543">Nature</a>, “What motivates people to pursue these big projects is not the belief that they will solve problems… It’s the belief that this is the way to get money.”</p></div>
